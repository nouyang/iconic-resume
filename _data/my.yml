      Gelsights are visual-tactile sensors used to give robots a sense of
      touch. The Digger Finger is miniature wedge-shaped gelsight
      specialized for digging in sand and other granular media. I helped
      prototype the physical design as well as the initial shape detection
      and annotation algorithm which used a YOLO-OBB model. Featured on MIT
      News.

    description: >-
      A novel miniature six-axis force/torque sensor. The sensor is
      low-cost (<$50) compared to other sensors which can cost up to tens
      of thousands of dollars (e.g. some ATI sensors). The sensing
      component itself uses simple webcam and a printed paper tag, allowing
      for easy customization and use. Design files and code are
      open-source (see website).

    description: |
      (Unpublished work) Implemeted robotic arm system capable of knife
      throwing (see realtime video for example) with automated environment
      reset for future reinforcement learning experiments. For the latter,  
      a simple ballistics model is used to calculate initial throw
      parameter, and the residual term would be calculated with a learned
      model on real-life data. Assisted by two high-school summer interns.

    description: |
      With Ashwin Krishna.
      Used a flywheel to invert a pendulum (built from scratch). In simulation, we derive the
      equations of motion and apply (linear quadartic regulator) LQR
      controls to our system. We also build a hardware system from scratch
      and implement swingup and stabilization using PD and bang-bang control. 
      #I did the analysis and controls and co-built the hardware system.
