      in sand and other granular media. I helped prototype the initial physical design and
      shape detection algorithm (a variant of YOLO with oriented boxes).

#As businesses, these locations have reviews both on mainstream websites (Google Maps) as well as niche websites (Rubmaps). By creating a classifier to extrapolate from the more limited Rubmaps dataset to the Google Maps dataset, we can gain an understanding of the distribution and degree of illicit activity in a geographic region.

#What I did: This is my own work, using Python and the SimpleTransformers library to finetune BERT models on this natural language processing classification task. Above: The standard data science tools (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn) are used to create the above plot exploring number of reviews posted per day, from Jan to Dec 2020, on a single website; Data from Heyrick Research courtesy of IBM.

##description: |
#With Ashwin Krishna.
#We built (from scratch) an inverted pendulum system that uses a flywheel
#and angle sensor. I used bang-bang and proportional-derivative (PD)
#controls to swing up the pendulum and stabilize it. In simulation, we
#derived the equations of motion and
#apply (linear quadartic regulator) LQR controls to our system.  
      
 #We also built a hardware system from scratch
 #and implement swingup and stabilization using PD and bang-bang control. 
#I did the analysis and controls and co-built the hardware system.
